# Employee Churn Prediction

Predicting employee churn using machine learning to identify employees likely to leave the organization.

## Overview
This project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation to predict employee turnover.

## Techniques Used
- **Decision Tree:** Provides interpretable classification based on employee features.  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Handles high-dimensional data for robust predictions.

## Key Highlights
- Cleaned and preprocessed employee dataset, including handling missing values and encoding categorical features.  
- Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- Compared Decision Tree and SVM to determine the most effective model for churn prediction.

## Outcome
The models help organizations take proactive measures to reduce employee turnover and improve retention strategies.
